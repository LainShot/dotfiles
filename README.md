All my configs and stuff... replace the **** with the OS. 

I run Ubuntu LTS builds on my workstation and Mac OS on my laptop. I have used other distros in the past but as of right now thats what I am using, yes there are other options but this is what works for me right now with what I have to do. 

- install_progs_******.sh - installs all of my programs.

- setup_vim_******.sh - installs vim and sets up .vimrc

- setup_tmux_******.sh - installs tmux and sets up my tmux config.
