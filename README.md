All my configs and stuff... replace the **** with the OS. 

I run ubuntu LTS builds on my workstation and Mac OS on my laptop. I have used other distros in the past but as of right now thats what I am using, yes there are other options but this is what works for me right now with what I have to do. 

- install_progs_******.sh - installs all of my programs.

- setup_vim_******.sh - installs vim and sets up .vimrc

- setup_tmux_******.sh - installs tmux and sets up my tmux config. 


These will work on other distros you will just have to update to use the right package manger such as pacman or yum, but I will leave that to you to fork if you wish and make the changes for your needs. I only update this for my current operating systems but will leave older ones in there in case I swap back. 

The only configs that are not in here are my openvms configs such as my @login.com file, as this contains infomation that can not be shared with the public. 

I doubt many of you use openvms anyway, or even know what it is. 

Have Fun!
